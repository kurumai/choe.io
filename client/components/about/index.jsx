				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
				I hold American, Canadian, and Korean passports, but really identify myself as a citizen of the world. Born in Toronto, I spent most of my formative years in the Bay Area. Fueled by a desire to explore an unknown city and an interest with working in a quantitative field, I left for New York University and graduated with a B.S. in Finance, after which I worked on trading floors for a few years—long enough to know that I had zero interest in working in the world of finance.
				</p>
				<p>
				I started writing macros in VBA, which then turned into learning SQL and some Python as I got more comfortable with coding while working as a data analyst, and even as a chef (another story for another time). Along the way, I’ve discovered a passion for building applications that I’m unable to shake. I love what I do and am looking forward to all the cool things that I'll inevitably be a part of.
				</p>
				<p>
				Let’s build something awesome together 🙌.
